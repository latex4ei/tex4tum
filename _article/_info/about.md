TeX4TUM is an Interactive Knowledge Platform for Engineers covering the following topics:


* üé≤ math
* üß™ physics
* ‚ö° electrical engineering
* ‚òÅ information theory
* üîß mechanical engineering




## Our Philosophy
With TeX4TUM, we offer an interactive knowledge platform that adjusts the content to your individual needs. In contrast to all the forums, blogs, and wikis out there, we focus on the most important aspects first and only optionally offer you the details if you need them. Our articles are short, consistent and well structured making them ideal for efficiently looking up your study topics.
Using interactive diagrams, you are not limited to static examples but can play around with different parameters and observe their effect on the result. This direct feedback will enable more intuitive understanding and helps to quickly learn or lookup even complex topics, reducing cognitive overload and letting you stay focused.
Experience it for yourself. Hit `tab` and type a term that you want to look up.



## Article Processing
Intuitive design does not stop when it comes to writing an article. Our goal is that authors do not need to bother about learning any complex markup or programming language.
As an author you simply write the article following some format guidelines. Afterwards, our smart scripts will process the article and figure out which content is visible by default and which content will appear on demand. For example, symbol explanations only appear when you click on the corresponding equation.



## Under the Hood
TeX4TUM uses many different frameworks to achieve its goals.

* Content Management: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Version Control: [GitHub](https://github.com/latex4ei/tex4tum)
* Markup Language: [Markdown](http://markdown.de/)
* Math: [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/)
* Responsive Design: [Bootstrap 4.0](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Fuzzy Search: [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io/)
* Interactive Images: SVG images

## Roadmap
Tex4TUM should eveolve to be your swiss knive of engineering knowledge. That is, we will focus on a few ($\approx 200$) high-quality articles instead of having thousands of ‚ÄúOK‚Äù articles.
First, we are completely open to any suggestions, new articles, and improvements from anyone in order to generate the content that matters most for the students.
After a few years when the articles are quite complete, the content should be maintained by trusted student groups, tutors, or researches of the university.
