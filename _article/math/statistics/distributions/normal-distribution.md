title: Normal Distribution
---

The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution in probability theory.


| Parameters |  |
|----|---|
| Notation | $\mathcal N(μ, σ^2), μ ∈ \R, σ > 0$ |
| Mean | $μ$ |
| Variance | $σ^2$ |
| PDF | $f_X (x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$, $x ∈ \R$ |


## Probability Density

$$f_X (x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$$
with the mean $\mu$, the standard deviation $\sigma$.


## Properties
* It is symmetric around the point $x=\mu$ which is at the same time the mode, the median and the mean of the distribution.
* The area under the curve and over the x-axis is equal to one.
