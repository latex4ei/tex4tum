## Signal Categories

Details: If a signal is both value‚Äìcontinuous  and  time‚Äìcontinuous, it is called a  analog signal. A  digital signal,  on the other hand,  is always value‚Äìdiscrete  and  time-discrete and the message contained therein consists of the symbols of a symbol set.



* **Time-Continuous Signal:** the signal parameter $t$ is defined at any given time.
* **Time-Discrete Signal:** the signal parameter is defined only at the discrete points $t_v = v \cdot T_A$.
* **Deterministic Signal:** the time function $x(t)$ can be described completely in analytical form.
* **Random Signal:** its time function $x(t)$ is not ‚Äì or at least not completely ‚Äì describable in mathematical form.  Such a signal cannot be predicted exactly for the future.
* **Causal Signal/System:** if $x(t)$ does not exist for all times $t < 0$ or is identical zero.
* **Energy‚ÄìLimited Signal:** if $x(t)$ has finite energy $E_x$ and infinitely small power ($P_x \to 0$)
* **Power‚ÄìLimited Signal:** if $x(t)$ has finite power $P_x$ and infinite energy $(E_x \to \infty)$.



### Examples of Signals

![Causal vs. Non-Causal Signal](https://en.lntwww.de/images/9/9e/EN_Sig_T_1_2_S2_v2.png)

You can see a causal system in the upper graphic: If a unit step function $x(t)$ is applied to its input, then the output signal ùë¶(ùë°) can only increase from zero to its maximum value after time ùë°=0. In the lower graph the causality is no longer given. As you can easily see in this example, an additional runtime of one millisecond is enough to change from the non-causal to the causal representation.


## Energy‚ÄìLimited and Power‚ÄìLimited Signals
Both, energy and power of a signal, are dependent on the resistance ùëÖ. In order to eliminate this dependency, the resistance ùëÖ=1Œ© is often used as a basis in communications engineering. Then the following definitions apply:

**The energy** in $\si{\text{V}^2\text{s}}$ of the signal $x(t)$ is:

$$E_x=\lim_{T_{\rm M}\to\infty} \int^{T_{\rm M}/2} _{-T_{\rm M}/2} x^2(t)\,{\rm d}t.$$

with $T_M$ is the assumed measurement duration during which the signal is observed, symmetrically with respect to the time origin ($t=0$).  In general, this time interval must be chosen very large; ideally $T_M$ should be towards infinity.

**The (mean) power** in $\si{\text{V}^2}$ is the energy divided by the time before the limit crossing:

$$P_x = \lim_{T_{\rm M}	\to \infty} \frac{1}{T_{\rm M} } \cdot \int^{T_{\rm M}/2} _{-T_{\rm M}/2} x^2(t)\,{\rm d}t.$$

with $T_M$ is the assumed measurement duration during which the signal is observed, symmetrically with respect to the time origin ($t=0$).  In general, this time interval must be chosen very large; ideally $T_M$ should be towards infinity.
