title: Modulation
---
Modulation is the process of embedding a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted.


## Analog modulation

* Amplitude modulation (AM)
* Frequency modulation (FM)
* Phase modulation (PM)


## Digital modulation

In digital modulation, an analog carrier signal is modulated by a discrete digital signal.

* Phase-Shift Keying (PSK): a finite number of phases are used.
* Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK): a finite number of frequencies are used.
* Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK): a finite number of amplitudes are used.
* Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM):
