I2C is a serial bus used to attach lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance.


## Specification

I2C uses only two bidirectional open collector or open drain lines, *SDA* and *SCK*, which are pulled up with resistors. Typical voltages used are $V_{DD} = +\SI{5}{V}$ or $V_{DD} = +\SI{3.3}{V}$.



### Transmission Speeds
I2C supports different transmission speeds. The possible speed depends on the value of the pull-up resistors and the capacity of the wires. If a lower resistance is used, the signal is faster pulled-up to $V_{DD}$ (which allows faster speeds) but also dissipates more energy through heat.

| Mode           | Speed      |
|----------------|------------|
| Standard Mode  | 100 kbit/s |
| Fast Mode      | 400 kbit/s |
| Fast Mode Plus | 1.0 Mbit/s |

## Protocol
There is one master and several slaves (max 127). The MSB is transmitted first.

        S     Addr  RW  ACK   Cmd   ACK   Data  ACK   P
```

### Timing
* Start (S): master pulls SDA low while SCL stays high.
* Data Bits (0-7): Sampling starts when SCL rises. For a bit to be valid, SDA must not change between a rising and falling edge of SCL.
* ACK: Each byte of data is followed by a 9th ACK bit. This bit is controlled by the slave! The master releases SDA (pulled high). The byte is acknowledged iff the slaves pulls SDA bit low. 0 = ACK, 1 = NAK.
* Stop (P): signaled when SCL rises, followed by SDA rising.


### Write to Device
1. Master sends Start bit.
1. Master sends Address+R/W: 7 bit slave address and one R/W bit (0=write). Slave ACKs.
1. Master sends a command byte followed by any number of data bytes. Slave ACKs every byte.


### Read from Device
1. Master sends Start bit.
1. Master sends Address+R/W: 7 bit slave address and one R/W bit (0=write). Slave ACKs.
1. Master sends the register address it wants to read from the Slave. Slave ACKs every byte.
1. Master resends Start bit.
1. Master sends 7 bit Address and R/W bit set to 1=read. Slave ACKs.
1. Master continues SCL but releases SDA. Slave sends requested data. Master ACKs every byte.
1. When the Master received the last expected byte, it sends a NAK instead of ACK followed by the Stop (P).
