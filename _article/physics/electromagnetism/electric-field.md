## Coulomb's law
From Coulomb's law a particle with electric charge $q_1$ at position $\vec x_1$ exerts a force on a particle with charge $q_0$ at position $\vec x_0$ of

$$\vec{F}= \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{0} }{ ( \vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_0 )^2}  \vec{r}_{\text{1,0}}$$
where $\vec{r}_{\text{1,0}}$ is the unit vector in the direction from point $\vec{x}_1$ to point $\vec{x}_2$, and $Îµ_0$ is the electric constant.
