IEEE 802.15.4 is the standard for “Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs)”



## Maximum Values
* Raw data rate: 250 kbps
* Transmission Power: 1 mW
* Typical range: 10 m
* PHY payload: 127 bytes
	Reason: to ensure low packet and bit error rates in a lossy RF environment
* Address: 16 bit or 64 bit


## Superframe Structure
The communication of IEEE 802.15.4 networks is structured into *Superframes*, which is the perdiod between two coordinator beacons. Each superframe consists of an active and an inactive period but the length of the inactive perdiod may be zero.

### Frame Structure

                            +-------------------------------+
                            | MAC head |   MAC   | MAC foot |
                            |   (MHR)  | payload |  (MFR)   |
                            +-------------------------------+
                              \                           /
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  Sync. header  |  PHY header  |     PHY payload       |
|     (SHR)      |    (PHR)     |        (PSDU)         |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is used to detect errors in every PSDU.

### Access Methods

* Unslotted CSMA-CA used in nonbeacon-enabled PANs
* Slotted CSMA-CA used in beacon-enabled PANs
* TSCH CCA used in non-shared slots in a TSCH PAN
* TSCH CSMA-CA used for shared slots in a TSCH PAN
* CSMA-CA with PCA in for critical events
* LECIM ALOHA with PCA




### Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME)
If several coordinators are present, the communication is structured into *Multi-Superframes*. A multi-superframe consists of repeated superframes, each of which consists of an Enhanced Beacon frame, a CAP and a CFP.



## Device Types

<div class="tabbox" markdown>

### FFD
A full-Function Device (FFD) is a device that is capable of serving as a personal area network (PAN) coordinator.


### RFD
A Reduced-Function Device (RFD) is a device that is not capable of serving as a coordinator and is intended for applications that are extremely simple.

## Physical Layer 1 (PHY)

### Features
* Link quality indicator (LQI) for received packets
* Channel frequency selection


|              |  868 MHz   |    2.4 GHz |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Modulation   | BPSK       |    O-QPSK  |
| Channels     |          1 |        16  |
| Bit Rate     |    20 kbps |   250 kbps |
| Symbols      | 1 bit/smyb | 4 bit/symb |
| Chips/Symbol |         15 |         32 |


### PHY Header (6 byte)
* Preamble: 4 byte all zero
* Start-of-frame delimiter: 1 byte (0b11100101)
* Length: 1 byte (bits 0-6, bit 7 reserved)



### Channels
* 3 channels available in 868MHz bands
* 30 channels available in the 915MHz bands
* 16 channels available in the 2.4GHz bands





## Medium Access Layer 2 (MAC)
* 4 types of MAC frames: Data, Beacon, Ack, Command
* typically 25 bytes MAC header


### Beacon Enabled
* PAN Coordinator sends beacons. The beacon interval defines one superframe. Each superframe is divided into 16 time slots.


Slots:
* Contention Access Period (CAP): competetive access with CSMA/CA or ALOHA, collisions possible
* Contention Free Period (CFP): slots are asigned to individual devices



* Access Management:
	- Scheduled access (“I Tell You when to Talk”) with beacons
	- Random access (“You Decide when to Talk but prepare for Collisions”)

* CSMA/CA
	1. Carrier Sense: prior to transmitting, a node first listens to the shared medium to determine whether another node is transmitting or not.
	1. Collision Avoidance: if another node was heard, we wait for a period of time (usually random) for the node to stop transmitting before listening again for a free communications channel.




## Link layer security
* AES-128
