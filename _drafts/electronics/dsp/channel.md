Bit Error Rate (BER): fraction of bit not correctly received (“1” for a “0” or viceversa)


## Signal to noise ratio (SNR)

SNR depends on: $P_R$, $N_A$, $N_R$
	with recieved power $P_$, thermal noise antenna $N_A$ and noise of the receiver $N_R$


Receiver Sensitivity: $P_{min} = P_r \cdot (N_A + N_R)$
