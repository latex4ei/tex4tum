## Direct conversion Flash Converter
A direct-conversion ADC or flash ADC has a bank of comparators sampling the input signal in parallel, each firing for their decoded voltage range.


## Successive approximation converter
A successive-approximation ADC uses a comparator to successively narrow a range that contains the input voltage.


## Sigma-delta ADC
