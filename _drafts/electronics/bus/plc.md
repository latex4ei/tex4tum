title: Power Line Communication (PLC)
---

Data transmission on the power line (230V). Range up to 300m.


| Method         | Rate       | Frequency   |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Homeplug       | 14 Mbit/s  | 4 .. 20 MHz |
| Homeplug Turbo | 85 Mbit/s  | 4 .. 20 MHz |
| Homeplug AV    | 200 Mbit/s | 2 .. 30 MHz |
| IEEE 1901      | 600 Mbit/s | 2 .. 68 MHz |
| IEEE 1901      | 1200 Mbit/s | 30 .. 68 MHz |


## Homeplug AV

28 MHz bandwidth with 1155 carriers at 24.414 kHz spacing.
Robust OFDM (ROBO) mode for highly reliable
transmission. The same information is transmitted on 2-5
subcarriers using a low-bit rate modulation


Adaptive bit loading: Each carrier is modulated based on the
noise level and multipath at that frequency.
2-bits/symbol to 10 bits/symbol.


## Application
Used in 1950 for remote ignition and lighting of street lights.
