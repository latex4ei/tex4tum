A quantum computer uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data.


## Concept

* Quantum computer using $n$ quibits: $2^n$ states simultaneously
* Classical computer using $n$ bits: only one state at a time


Details: A quantum computer uses qubits. A single qubit can represent a one, a zero, or any quantum superposition of those two qubit states. A pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 states and three qubits in any superposition of 8 states. In general, a quantum computer with $n$ qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to $2^{n}$ different states simultaneously.



## Benefits
A quantum computer can perform operations that take $O(n)$ operations on classical computers in $O(\sqrt{n})$. If $n$ is large, this will vastly decrease the computation time.
