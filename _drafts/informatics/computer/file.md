## File Descriptor
Is a non-negative number.
UNIX shells assign file descriptor 0 to the standard input of a process, file descriptor 1 to the standard output of the process and file descriptor 2 to the standard error.



The kernel uses descriptor reference counts to decide whether to close a file or not.
