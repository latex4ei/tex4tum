The General's Problem describe an agreement problem about reaching consensus when communicating over an unreliable channel.



Mapping: computers are the generals and their digital communication links are the messengers.



## Two General's Problem

Two alayed generals, each leading an army, want to coordinate a simultanuous attack.
The only way for the two generals to communicate is by sending messengers through a valley which is occupied by enemies.
There's a chance that any given messenger sent through the valley will be captured and the message will be lost.

The challenge is how the two generals agree on a specific time for the attack (reach consensus).

### Approaches
* Send many messengers to increase the probabilty that the message reaches the other general.



## Byzantine Generals' Problem
A group of $n$ generals wish to formulate a plan for attacking the city.
In its simplest form, the generals must only decide whether to attack or retreat.
The important thing is that every general agrees on a common decision, because a halfhearted attack by a few generals is worse than a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

The problem is complicated by the presence of traitorous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so by selectively sending different messages to different generals.
