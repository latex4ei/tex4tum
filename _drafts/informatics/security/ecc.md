title: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
---
Elliptic curve cryptography is a crypto-system based on the math around elliptic curves.


An elliptic curve can be given by the equation

$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$
with the addtional constraint $4a^2 + 27b^2 \ne 0$


## Elliptic Curve Math
$P + Q + R = 0$ where $0$ refers to a point in infintiy.


## Standard curves
Only some parameter sets are secure and useful for craptography.

Popular curves:
* secp256k1
* Curve25519



## Security
The elliptic curve discrete logarithm is the hard problem in ECC.


Breaking a 228-bit RSA key requires less energy than it takes to boil a teaspoon of water. Comparatively, breaking a 228-bit elliptic curve key requires enough energy to boil all the water on earth.
