title: Symmetric Encryption
---

Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.


## Types
* Stream ciphers: encrypt the digits of a message one at a time.
* Block ciphers: take a number of bits and encrypt them as a single unit, padding the plaintext so that it is a multiple of the block size.
